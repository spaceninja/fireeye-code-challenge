# FireEye Front-End Code Challenge

* Build a small JS app using the attached mockup
* Tweet data should be loaded dynamically from a json file
* You _can_ use _any_ JS framework of your choice or no framework at all
* You should _NOT_ use any CSS frameworks or any existing CSS code
* You can use a third party icon library and any public images you want
* Feel free to add any functionality, details, etc that will help show your skills

## Scott's Notes

* The mockup provided was a low-resolution screenshot, so I replaced the icons in the header bar with open-source SVG icons from FontAwesome. For a real client project, I'd work with the designer to get the proper SVG assets.
* Because the mock was low-resolution, I've replaced the photos (the black and white photo of Arnold and the photo user avatar) with some stock assets.
* The twitter user avatars don't match the comp because I grabbed the live avatars from Twitter.
* Some twitter functionality has been emulated — faving, retweeting, replying, and search, as well as composing a tweet.
* Mobile-friendly

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
